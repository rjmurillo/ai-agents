| 3 | Create session log | ✅ COMPLETE | This file |

## Session Context

- **Starting Commit**: `7a84eaf`
- **Session Type**: PR comment response
- **Work Scope**: Address 1 new review comment (10/10 total)
- **Note**: Starting commit is PR #143 initial commit, before prior session fixes

3. Acknowledge all comments with eyes emoji
4. Triage and analyze each comment independently
5. Implement fixes or reply as appropriate
6. Verify all comments addressed

## PR Comment Response Workflow

### Phase 1: Context Gathering

- [x] Fetch PR metadata (Get-PRContext.ps1)
- [x] Enumerate all reviewers (Get-PRReviewers.ps1)
- [x] Retrieve ALL comments with pagination (Get-PRReviewComments.ps1)
- [x] Verify comment count

**Results**:
- PR #143: docs: add feature request review workflow planning artifacts
- Branch: docs/planning-and-architecture → main
- State: OPEN
- Files: 5 (planning documents only, no code)
- Total Comments: 19 (10 top-level, 9 replies)
- Reviewers: 8 total (4 bots, 4 humans including rjmurillo-bot)
- Active Reviewers: gemini-code-assist[bot] (3 comments), Copilot (7 comments)
- Prior Session Work: 9/10 comments already addressed by rjmurillo-bot
- New This Session: 1 comment (Copilot #2638092259)

### Phase 2: Comment Map Generation

- [x] Acknowledge NEW comment with eyes emoji (comment 2638092259)
- [x] Generate comment map at `.agents/pr-comments/PR-143/comments.md`
- [x] Verify eyes_count for new comment

**Results**:
- Eyes reaction added to comment 2638092259
- Comment map created with all 10 comments documented
- Prior session work: 9 comments already handled
- Session 55 work: 1 new comment

### Phase 3: Analysis

- [x] Analyze new comment independently (no orchestrator needed - simple Won't Fix)
- [x] Document analysis in comment map

**Results**:
- Comment 2638092259: Copilot suggests linking to Serena memory file
- Analysis: Memory files are different artifact type, plain text reference is appropriate
- Classification: Won't Fix (with rationale)

### Phase 4: Task List Generation

- [x] Identify immediate action needed

**Results**:
- No implementation tasks (planning-only PR)
- Action: Reply to new comment with Won't Fix rationale

### Phase 5: Immediate Replies

- [x] Reply to Won't Fix comment with justification

**Results**:
- Reply 2638106131 posted to comment 2638092259
- Explained memory files vs ADR cross-reference distinction
- No @mention needed (informational response)

### Phase 6: Implementation

**SKIPPED** - No code changes required (planning documents only)

### Phase 7: PR Description Update

- [x] Review changes against description

**Results**:
- PR description accurate (planning artifacts for feature request review)
- No update needed

### Phase 8: Completion Verification

- [x] Verify all comments addressed
- [x] Check for pending items

**Results**:
- Total Comments: 10
- Addressed: 10/10 (100%)
- Prior Session: 9 (6 fixed in 1da29cc, 3 declined style suggestions)
- This Session: 1 (Won't Fix with rationale)
- Pending Items: 0

## Memory Retrieval

**Memories Read**:
- pr-comment-responder-skills (actionability rates, workflow skills)
- cursor-bot-review-patterns (100% actionable, prioritize)
- copilot-pr-review-patterns (consistency checking)
- pr-review-noise-skills (false positive patterns)

**Key Context**:
- cursor[bot]: 100% actionable (12/12 comments across 4 PRs)
- Copilot: ~50% actionable, improving
- CodeRabbit: ~50% actionable
- Always enumerate ALL reviewers before triaging
- Each comment analyzed independently (no grouping)
- Verify eyes_count before Phase 3

## Key Findings

**PR Type**: Planning/Documentation only (no code implementation)

**Comment Distribution**:
- gemini-code-assist[bot]: 3 comments (all style suggestions, 0% actionable)
- Copilot: 7 comments (6 fixed in prior session, 1 Won't Fix this session, 86% actionable)

**Notable Pattern**: Copilot performed well above historical average (86% vs 50%) on this PR. All 6 actionable comments identified real consistency issues between ADR and planning documents.

**Efficiency**: Prior session handled bulk of work (9/10 comments), this session only needed to address 1 new comment that arrived after prior session completed.

## Notes

**Session 55 Workflow Adaptation**:
- Standard 8-phase pr-comment-responder workflow adapted for planning-only PR
- No implementer/QA delegation needed (Phase 6 skipped)
- Simple Won't Fix decision made directly without orchestrator (no ambiguity)
- Focus on documentation consistency rather than code correctness

# Session 372: Clean Up Memory Skill Extraneous Documentation

**Date**: 2026-01-03
**Branch**: fix/update-skills-valid-frontmatter
**Session Type**: Cleanup

## Objective

Remove extraneous documentation files from the `memory` skill that violate skill-creator "no auxiliary files" rule:
- `references/README.md` - Explicitly prohibited by skill-creator
- `references/HISTORY.md` - Changelog/history files not permitted

## Context

Continuing skill frontmatter standardization and cleanup from Session 366-370. The memory skill contains documentation files that need to be removed per skill-creator requirements.

## Decisions

## Actions

1. Verified memory skill cleanup - README.md and HISTORY.md already removed in commit 7e61c3e
2. Removed changelog sections from 3 skills:
   - adr-review/SKILL.md (lines 149-162, 14 lines)
   - research-and-incorporate/SKILL.md (lines 137-145, 9 lines)
   - SkillForge/SKILL.md (lines 855-888, 36 lines)
3. Removed version/date metadata footers from 2 skills:
   - security-detection/SKILL.md (6 lines: version, created date, issue ref)
   - metrics/SKILL.md (6 lines: version, created date, issue ref)

## Outcomes

- C2 (Extraneous Documentation): Verified already resolved
- M2 (Changelog Sections): Removed from 3 skills (59 lines)
- M3 (Version/Date Metadata): Removed from 2 skills (12 lines)
- Total: 71 lines of auxiliary documentation removed
- All skills now compliant with skill-creator "no auxiliary context" requirement
- Changes staged: 5 files modified

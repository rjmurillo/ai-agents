# Session 372: Clean Up Memory Skill Extraneous Documentation

**Date**: 2026-01-03
**Branch**: fix/update-skills-valid-frontmatter
**Session Type**: Cleanup

## Objective

Remove extraneous documentation files from the `memory` skill that violate skill-creator "no auxiliary files" rule:
- `references/README.md` - Explicitly prohibited by skill-creator
- `references/HISTORY.md` - Changelog/history files not permitted

## Context

Continuing skill frontmatter standardization and cleanup from Session 366-370. The memory skill contains documentation files that need to be removed per skill-creator requirements.

## Decisions

## Actions

1. Verified memory skill cleanup - README.md and HISTORY.md already removed in commit 7e61c3e
2. Removed changelog sections from 3 skills:
   - adr-review/SKILL.md (lines 149-162, 14 lines)
   - research-and-incorporate/SKILL.md (lines 137-145, 9 lines)
   - SkillForge/SKILL.md (lines 855-888, 36 lines)
3. Removed version/date metadata footers from 2 skills:
   - security-detection/SKILL.md (6 lines: version, created date, issue ref)
   - metrics/SKILL.md (6 lines: version, created date, issue ref)

## Outcomes

- C2 (Extraneous Documentation): Verified already resolved
- M2 (Changelog Sections): Removed from 3 skills (59 lines)
- M3 (Version/Date Metadata): Removed from 2 skills (12 lines)
- Total: 71 lines of auxiliary documentation removed
- All skills now compliant with skill-creator "no auxiliary context" requirement
- Changes staged: 5 files modified

## Commits

1. `e0609b4` - fix(skills): remove changelog sections per skill-creator spec
   - adr-review, research-and-incorporate, SkillForge (59 lines)
2. `ee9e283` - fix(skills): remove version/date metadata footers per skill-creator spec
   - security-detection, metrics (12 lines)
3. `5dc2231` - docs: add session 372 cleanup documentation

## Skill Description and Trigger Review

Conducted comprehensive review of all 28 skills:

### Analysis Results

- **9 skills (32%)** have explicit Triggers sections
- **18 skills (64%)** lack Triggers sections
- **3 skills (11%)** missing descriptions entirely (github, merge-resolver, programming-advisor)

### Documents Created

1. **Analysis**: `.agents/analysis/skill-description-trigger-review.md`
   - Comprehensive review of all skills
   - Quality ratings (Excellent/Good/Needs Improvement)
   - Prioritized recommendations (P0/P1/P2)
   - Metrics and patterns

2. **Standard**: `.agents/governance/skill-description-trigger-standard.md`
   - Description formula: verb + what + when + outcome
   - Trigger section requirements: 3-5 phrases, table format
   - Complete examples and patterns by skill type
   - Validation rules and checklists
   - Migration guide for existing skills

### Key Findings

**Excellent Examples**:
- session-log-fixer: Includes exact error messages as triggers
- SkillForge: Multi-category trigger organization
- github: Operation-mapped table format

**Priority Fixes Needed**:
- P0: Add descriptions for 3 skills with empty descriptions
- P0: Add trigger sections to top 5 most-used skills
- P1: Enhance trigger sections for skills with implicit triggers

## Next Steps

- Ready to push changes to origin
- Apply standard to new skills going forward
- Consider P0 fixes for skills missing descriptions

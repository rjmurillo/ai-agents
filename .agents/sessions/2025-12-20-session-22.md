# Session Log: 2025-12-20-session-22

**Date**: 2025-12-20
**Agent**: critic
**Type**: Architecture Critique
**Task**: Evaluate token efficiency principle and PRD architectural decision

## Protocol Compliance

### Phase 1: Serena Initialization [PASS]
- mcp__serena__initial_instructions: ✅ Complete

### Phase 2: Context Retrieval [PASS]
- .agents/HANDOFF.md: ✅ Read (partial - first 100 lines)
- Context: Session 49 - Semantic slug proposal rejected, PRD approved

### Phase 3: Session Log [PASS]
- Session log created: 2025-12-20-session-22.md

## Task Summary

Critique the foundational principle in PRD-skills-index-registry.md:

**Principle**: "Memory file names and index statements MUST contain dense, high-signal keywords because agents select memories based on word frequency matching."

**Evaluate**:
1. Falsifiability
2. Hidden assumptions
3. Alternative explanations
4. Missing analysis
5. Verdict (BLOCK or APPROVE)

## Context from HANDOFF.md

Session 49 completed rigorous validation of semantic slug proposal:
- Verdict: BLOCKED (4 critical flaws)
- 10-agent consensus approved PRD-skills-index-registry
- Key finding: "Serena MCP abstracts file names from agents"

## Relevant Memories

- skill-memory-token-efficiency: Defines the principle under critique
- prd-agent-consolidation-context: Related consolidation discussion
- skills-critique: Conflict escalation protocols
- skill-memory-001-feedback-retrieval: User feedback retrieval patterns

## Session Outcome

[APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS]

Created comprehensive critique document: `.agents/critique/050-token-efficiency-principle-critique.md`

### Key Findings

1. **Principle contains valid core + speculative mechanism**:
   - VALID: Focused reads reduce token waste (measurable)
   - INVALID: "Word frequency matching" (speculative, unverified)
   - VAGUE: "Dense, high-signal keywords" (no operationalization)

2. **Architectural decision is SOUND**:
   - Atomic files + index registry is correct choice
   - 68% performance improvement (per PRD estimates)
   - Backwards compatible, low risk
   - Governance well-defined

3. **Rationale needs revision**:
   - Emphasize: Token waste, focused reads, O(1) index lookup
   - Remove: Word frequency matching, file name density claims
   - Separate: Verified facts from speculative mechanisms

### Recommendations

1. [BLOCKING] Implement PRD-skills-index-registry.md per critique conditions
2. [BLOCKING] Revise skill-memory-token-efficiency memory to separate facts from speculation
3. [BLOCKING] Implement PRD-skill-retrieval-instrumentation.md to validate claims
4. [NON-BLOCKING] Document operational costs (maintenance burden analysis)

### Meta-Analysis

**Is this cargo cult?**
- PARTIALLY: Contains genuine insights (token efficiency) wrapped in speculative theory (word frequency matching)
- RISK: Treating speculation as fact may optimize wrong variables
- MITIGATION: Instrumentation → measurement → revision based on data

### Next Steps

Route to orchestrator with critique document for implementation coordination.

  "summary": "Fixed PR #955 validation failure by triggering a new workflow run after the commit-limit-bypass label was added. The PR has 86 commits (exceeding the 20-commit limit), but the bypass label now allows it to pass validation. The workflow enforcement logic correctly checks for the bypass label and allows the PR to proceed when present."

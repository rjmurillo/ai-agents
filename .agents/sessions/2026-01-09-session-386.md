## Work Completed

### Deliverables

1. **Analysis**: `.agents/analysis/agentskills-io-standard-2026-01.md`
   - Comprehensive analysis of agentskills.io official specification
   - Compatibility assessment with ai-agents project

2. **Architecture**: `.agents/architecture/SKILL-STANDARDS-RECONCILED.md`
   - Authoritative skill standards reference (840 lines, 81 sections)
   - Resolved 5 major conflicts
   - Two-tier requirement system (2 official, 5 ai-agents extensions)

3. **Serena Memories**:
   - `agentskills-io-standard-integration.md` - Standard adoption status
   - `skills-standards-reconciled.md` - Quick reference (renamed from skill- prefix)

4. **Forgetful Memories**: Created 5 new memories (IDs 175-179)
   - Memory 175: "Skill Standards: Official vs ai-agents Requirements" (supersedes 5 old memories)
   - Memory 176: "Skill Frontmatter: Two-Tier Requirement System"
   - Memory 177: "Skill Model Field: Project-Specific Extension"
   - Memory 178: "Skill Version Field Placement: Top-Level Convention"
   - Memory 179: "Skill allowed-tools Format: Space-Delimited Standard"

5. **Memory Cleanup**: Obsoleted 5 fragmented memories
   - IDs: 99, 168, 101, 108, 130
   - All marked with superseded_by: 175

### Key Decisions

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Established SKILL-STANDARDS-RECONCILED.md as authoritative reference
2. **Two-Tier Standards**: Official (2 required fields) + ai-agents extensions (5 required fields)
3. **Memory Consolidation**: Marked old fragmented memories obsolete to eliminate confusion
4. **Naming Compliance**: Renamed memory to skills-standards-reconciled.md (ADR-017)

### Patterns Learned

- Authoritative consolidation over fragmentation
- Two-tier standards compliance (official + project extensions)
- Memory obsolescence with superseded_by links

The following items were identified but not converted to issues:
- Generic "TODO" markers in bot failure messages (not actionable)
- Nitpick comments already addressed in follow-up commits
- "should be" patterns in passing AI Quality Gate reviews (suggestions, not homework)
- Duplicate detection comments that were recommendations, not deferred work

- Full context from original PR comment
- Source PR and comment ID references
- Current state and proposed solution

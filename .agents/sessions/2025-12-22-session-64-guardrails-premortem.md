## Pre-Mortem Exercise

**Scenario**: 3 months from now, Local Guardrails has FAILED.
- Bypass rate: 80%
- Developer sentiment: Negative
- COGS impact: None (AI Quality Gate still running at same rate)

**Analysis Required**:
1. Root causes of failure
2. Cultural factors that prevented adoption
3. Technical issues that made it unusable
4. Warning signs we missed in spec/plan phase

**Output Format**: PRE-MORTEM VERDICT with risk level, failure scenario, root causes, warning signs, preventive actions

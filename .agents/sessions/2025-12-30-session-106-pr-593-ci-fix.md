### Comment Analysis

Total comments: 6
- gemini-code-assist[bot]: Unable to review (file type not supported)

- coderabbitai[bot] (2): Failed to post review (infrastructure issue)

## Learnings

1. CodeRabbit failures with "Failed to post review comments" are infrastructure issues on their side, not PR problems
2. The Get-PRChecks.ps1 skill correctly distinguishes between required and optional checks
3. User's triage comment is informational only - doesn't require agent response
4. Exit code 1 from Get-PRChecks.ps1 indicates failure, but the JSON output shows which checks failed

# REQ-001: Traceability Graph Performance

Optimize the markdown-based traceability graph for performance, robustness, and durability.

## Context

From PR #715 review feedback about the "poor man's graph database" implementation.

## Requirements

1. Fast graph traversal even with hundreds of specs
2. Handle malformed specs gracefully
3. Graph state survives across sessions without corruption

# feat: Expand MCP Tool Ecosystem (GitHub, Performance, Neural)

## Summary

Expand the MCP tool ecosystem with dedicated tools for GitHub operations, performance monitoring, and neural features.

## Background

Claude-flow provides 100+ MCP tools organized into categories: Swarm Coordination, Neural Networks, Memory, Analysis, GitHub Integration, and Workflow Automation. Their ruv-swarm MCP adds 27 specialized tools.

## Current State

- cloudmcp-manager for memory
- Serena for code navigation
- Manual gh CLI usage via skills
- No dedicated performance tools
- No neural feature tools

## Proposed Solution

1. **GitHub Integration Tools**:
   - `github_repo_analyze`: Repository structure analysis
   - `github_pr_manage`: PR creation, review, merge
   - `github_issue_track`: Issue management, labeling
   - `github_release_manage`: Release coordination
   
2. **Performance Tools**:
   - `performance_report`: Generate performance summary
   - `bottleneck_analyze`: Identify performance issues
   - `benchmark_run`: Execute benchmarks
   
3. **Neural/Learning Tools**:
   - `neural_train`: Train patterns from workflows
   - `neural_patterns`: Query learned patterns
   - `learning_adapt`: Apply adaptive learning
   
4. **Coordination Tools**:
   - `swarm_init`: Initialize coordination mode
   - `agent_spawn`: Batch agent creation
   - `task_orchestrate`: Workflow coordination

## Benefits

- Unified tool interface for common operations
- Reduce skill dependencies for standard tasks
- Enable tool-based automation
- Foundation for advanced coordination

## Implementation Notes

- Consider MCP server implementation
- Or integrate as Serena extensions
- Add tool documentation and examples
- Support tool chaining patterns

## Reference

See claude-flow's MCP Tools Reference (wiki page 13.2).

<!-- AI-PRD-GENERATION -->

## 📋 Product Requirements Document

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This PRD was automatically generated based on issue triage escalation.
> **Complexity Score**: 11/12 ()
> **Escalation Criteria**: feature_request, research_required, multi_phase_work, architectural_impact, external_dependency

<details>
<summary>📖 About this PRD</summary>

This PRD was generated by the **Explainer Agent** after the issue was flagged
for detailed analysis. The document is designed to be self-contained - it can
be passed to a separate AI agent instance for implementation without additional
context.

**PRD Depth Levels**:
- **Standard** (4-6): Brief analysis, clear requirements
- **Detailed** (7-9): Research section, blocking questions
- **Comprehensive** (10-12): Phased implementation, risk analysis

</details>

Let me search for claude-flow to understand what the issue is referencing.

Now I have sufficient context. Let me create a comprehensive PRD for the MCP Tool Ecosystem expansion feature.

The file creation failed. Let me check if the planning directory exists and output the PRD content directly:

PRD created for **feat: Expand MCP Tool Ecosystem (GitHub, Performance, Neural)**

## Summary

**Verdict**: REQUIRES_DISCOVERY

| Scope | Status | Blocker |
|-------|--------|---------|
| GitHub Integration Tools | :yellow_circle: PARTIAL | Architecture decision needed |
| Performance Tools | :red_circle: BLOCKED | No clear problem statement |
| Neural/Learning Tools | :red_circle: BLOCKED | Requires architecture investigation |
| Coordination Tools | :red_circle: BLOCKED | May duplicate orchestrator |

## Critical Blockers (3)

1. **claude-flow Reference**: The issue references "wiki page 13.2" but provides no link. Source cannot be verified.

2. **User Value Proposition**: No specific user stories describing friction points with current GitHub skills, performance needs, or learning requirements.

3. **Architecture Decision**: Three options exist (standalone MCP server, Serena extension, enhanced skills) with no stated preference.

## Key Findings

- **Existing GitHub skills work**: PowerShell scripts in `.claude/skills/github/` already handle PR, issue, label, milestone operations
- **Skill-usage-mandatory memory**: Agents are already required to use these skills
- **ADR-005/006 compliance**: Any new tools must wrap (not duplicate) existing PowerShell scripts
- **Conflict risk**: Proposed tools may duplicate orchestrator and skillbook agent functionality

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Request issue author provide claude-flow documentation link
2. Request specific user stories for each tool category
3. Create architecture ADR if proceeding
4. Treat as ideation backlog item until blockers resolved

The full PRD content is ready for saving to `.agents/planning/PRD-mcp-tool-ecosystem-expansion.md` when file creation permissions are available.

# Unmerged PRs Triage Checklist

This document tracks unmerged PRs created by the `rjmurillo-bot` account. The bot account
has been limited by GitHub, so these PRs need to be triaged to determine:

1. Should the work be salvaged and re-submitted?
2. Should the PR be closed as obsolete?
3. Is there valuable content to extract before closing?

## Instructions for Agent

For each PR below:

1. Read the linked markdown file
2. Assess whether the changes are still relevant
3. Determine action: **salvage**, **close**, or **extract-and-close**
4. Update the checkbox and add a brief note

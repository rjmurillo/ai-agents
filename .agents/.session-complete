# Session Complete

Investigation and fix for PR Maintenance workflow run 20496517728 is complete.

## Root Cause
PR Maintenance script exits early (exit 0) without visible output when:
1. Lock held (concurrent execution detected)
2. Rate limit low (GitHub API below safety thresholds)

## Solution
Added GitHub Actions step summaries for early exits showing:
- Why 0 PRs processed
- Rate limit status and reset time
- Next expected run time

## Commits
- ed4b314: fix: Add GitHub Actions summary for PR maintenance early exits
- da3d1e6: docs: Add session log and analysis (this commit)

## Impact
Future workflow runs show clear step summaries explaining early exits.

**Target PRs**: 137, 135, 119, 114, 112, 100, 98, 95, 94, 93, 89, 87, 79, 76, 75, 70, 69, 67, 63, 60, 59, 58, 57, 56, 55, 54, 53

## Search Patterns

- "Deferred to follow-up"
- "future improvement"
- "A future improvement could be"
- "TODO" in comments
- "follow-up task"
- "out of scope for this PR"
- "addressed in a future PR"

## Findings

Scanned 27 PRs and found 43 potential homework items across reviews and comments. After filtering out generic bot TODOs and focusing on actionable deferred work, identified 5 concrete homework items requiring follow-up issues.

## Homework Items Deferred (Not Creating Issues)

The following items were identified but not converted to issues:
- Generic "TODO" markers in bot failure messages (not actionable)
- Nitpick comments already addressed in follow-up commits
- "should be" patterns in passing AI Quality Gate reviews (suggestions, not homework)
- Duplicate detection comments that were recommendations, not deferred work

## Summary

Successfully identified and created 5 tracking issues for deferred work from PR reviews. All issues include:
- Full context from original PR comment
- Source PR and comment ID references
- Current state and proposed solution
- Proper labeling for categorization

Next step: Reply to original PR comments with links to created issues.

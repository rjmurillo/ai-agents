## Work Log

### PR #811 Review Response

**Status**: Complete

**What was done**:
- Verified PR merge state via Test-PRMerged.ps1 (not merged)

- Resolved the review thread using Resolve-PRReviewThread.ps1
- Verified CI checks: All 58 checks passing; mergeable=MERGEABLE

**Decisions made**:
- Resolve thread after reply since change already present in repository; no code edits required

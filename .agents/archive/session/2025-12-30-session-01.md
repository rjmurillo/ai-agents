## Work Log

### ADR-032 Review - Evidence Verification

**Status**: Complete

**What was done**:
1. Verified ADR-032 numbering conflict with PR #557 (exit code standardization)
2. Traced PR #226 evidence to retrospective (6 defects confirmed)
3. Searched Session 97 logs (3 variants found, "3 critic + 2 QA iterations" claim NOT found)
4. Verified 60% CRITICAL_FAIL rate claim exists but is statistically challenged (n=8, need n≥96)
5. Reviewed related issues #265, #219, #258 (all align with pre-PR/protocol enforcement)
6. Assessed feasibility gaps (missing effort estimate, rollout strategy, compatibility)

**Decisions made**:
- **Verdict**: NEEDS REVISION (85% confidence)
- **Blocking**: ADR-032 numbering conflict with PR #557 must be resolved
- Recommend renumbering to ADR-033 or next available

**Challenges**:
- Session 97 claim could not be verified in any of 3 session variants
- 60% baseline statistic disputed by Analysis 065 (insufficient sample size)
- Root cause misalignment: PR #226 failure broader than missing skill gates

**Files created**:
- `.agents/analysis/066-adr-032-skill-phase-gates-review.md` - Complete independent review

**Key Findings**:
- Gap identification is valid (skills lack internal gates)
- Problem severity overstated (unverified claims, statistical rigor concerns)
- Significant overlap with Issues #265, #219, #258
- Feasibility assessment missing (32 skills × gate implementation effort unknown)

## Session End (COMPLETE ALL before closing)

| Req | Step | Status | Evidence |
|-----|------|--------|----------|

| MUST | Update Serena memory (cross-session context) | [x] | debate-002-everything-deterministic-evaluation created |
| MUST | Run markdown lint | [x] | Lint clean |
| MUST | Route to qa agent (feature implementation) | [N/A] | Review only, no code changes |
| MUST | Commit all changes (including .serena/memories) | [x] | Commit SHA: 73a718a |
| MUST NOT | Update `.agents/HANDOFF.md` directly | [x] | HANDOFF.md unchanged |
| SHOULD | Update PROJECT-PLAN.md | [N/A] | Not applicable |
| SHOULD | Invoke retrospective (significant sessions) | [N/A] | Not applicable |
| SHOULD | Verify clean git status | [x] | Clean after commit |

## Notes for Next Session

**Critical Issues**:
1. ADR-032 numbering conflict with PR #557 - must renumber before proceeding
2. Session 97 evidence claim unverified - consider removing or finding source
3. 60% baseline disputed by Analysis 065 (n=8 insufficient)

**Coordination Needed**:
- Align with Issue #265 (Pre-PR Validation EPIC)
- Align with Issue #219 (Session State MCP)
- Align with Issue #258 (QA pre-PR gate)

**Review Location**: `.agents/analysis/066-adr-032-skill-phase-gates-review.md`

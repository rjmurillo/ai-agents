## Session Summary

**Duration**: Autonomous development session
**PRs Created**: 4
**Issues Closed**: 1 (already satisfied)

### Workflow Applied

1. Listed priority issues (P0/P1/P2)
2. Selected highest-impact unassigned issues
3. Created worktree branches for isolation
4. Implemented fixes with multi-agent reviews
5. Created PRs with proper template formatting

### Key Decisions

- Closed #702 without PR (all ADRs already in "Accepted" status)
- Split canonical sources into formal/de-facto categories (#675)
- Applied same error handling pattern across all success paths (#699)

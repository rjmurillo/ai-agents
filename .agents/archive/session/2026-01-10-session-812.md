## Work Summary

### Conflict Identified

Attempting merge with main revealed conflict in:
- `.serena/memories/session-113-pr-713-review.md` (add/add conflict)

### Resolution Strategy

Applied auto-resolvable pattern per memory "merge-resolver-auto-resolvable-patterns":
- `.serena/memories/*` files accept main branch version
- Main is authoritative for Serena memories

### Conflict Resolution

**Conflict**: Script name reference
- HEAD: `Validate-Session.ps1`
- main: `Validate-SessionJson.ps1`
**Resolution**: Accepted main version (correct script name)

### Merge Completed

Resolved conflict manually by accepting main's version of the script reference. Merge completed with commit including Co-Authored-By attribution.

**Merge Commit**: 50b05eb9 - chore: merge main into feat/662-investigation-eligibility-skill

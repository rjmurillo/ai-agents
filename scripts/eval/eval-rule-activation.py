"""Rule Activation Eval: measure whether rules and skill references actually fire.

Tests how a rule or skill reference activates across loading mechanisms:
  - baseline       : no rule context (control)
  - description    : only the rule description, or the skill catalog front door
                     plus skill router, must select the reference before use
  - full           : entire rule body, or skill router plus selected reference body,
                     in system prompt as a diagnostic ceiling

Each scenario is graded by an LLM judge on three dimensions (1-5):
  - activation_score : did the response apply rule-specific guidance vs generic advice?
  - citation_score   : did the response use the rule's specific vocabulary?
  - behavior_score   : did the response gate behavior on the rule's preconditions?

Compares mechanisms per scenario, aggregates to per-rule verdict.

Usage:
    # Eval one rule
    python3 scripts/eval/eval-rule-activation.py \
        --scenarios tests/evals/rule-scenarios/working-with-legacy-code.json

    # Dry run (skip API calls)
    python3 scripts/eval/eval-rule-activation.py \
        --scenarios tests/evals/rule-scenarios/working-with-legacy-code.json --dry-run

    # Multiple rules at once
    python3 scripts/eval/eval-rule-activation.py \
        --scenarios tests/evals/rule-scenarios/*.json

    # Save results
    python3 scripts/eval/eval-rule-activation.py \
        --scenarios tests/evals/rule-scenarios/working-with-legacy-code.json \
        --output rule-activation-results.json

Exit codes:
    0 ok
    1 logic (one or more rules failed activation gate)
    2 config (missing rule, scenarios file invalid)
    3 external (API failure)
    4 auth   (missing ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)

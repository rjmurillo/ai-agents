Every skill is evaluated through the evolution lens:

### Temporal Projection

| Timeframe | Key Question |
|-----------|--------------|
| 6 months | How will usage patterns evolve? |
| 1 year | What ecosystem changes are likely? |
| 2 years | What new capabilities might obsolete this? |
| 5 years | Is the core problem still relevant? |

### Timelessness Scoring

| Score | Description | Verdict |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| 1-3 | Transient, will be obsolete in months | Reject |
| 4-6 | Moderate, depends on current tooling | Revise |
| **7-8** | **Solid, principle-based, extensible** | **Approve** |
| 9-10 | Timeless, addresses fundamental problem | Exemplary |

**Requirement:** All skills must score ≥7.

### Anti-Obsolescence Patterns

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Design around principles | Hardcode implementations |
| Document the WHY | Only document the WHAT |
| Include extension points | Create closed systems |
| Abstract volatile dependencies | Direct coupling |
| Version-agnostic patterns | Pin specific versions |

# Merge Resolver

Resolve merge conflicts by analyzing git history and commit intent.

## Triggers

Use this skill when you encounter:

- `resolve merge conflicts for PR #123`
- `PR has conflicts with main`
- `can't merge - conflicts detected`
- `fix the merge conflicts in this branch`
- `help me resolve conflicts for this pull request`

## Process

### Phase 1: Context Gathering

| Step | Action | Verification |
|------|--------|--------------|
| 1.1 | Fetch PR metadata | JSON response received |
| 1.2 | Checkout PR branch | `git branch --show-current` matches |
| 1.3 | Attempt merge with base | Conflict markers created |
| 1.4 | List conflicted files | `git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U` output |

### Phase 2: Analysis and Resolution

| Step | Action | Verification |
|------|--------|--------------|
| 2.1 | Classify files (auto-resolvable vs manual) | Classification logged |
| 2.2 | Auto-resolve template/session files | Accept --theirs successful |
| 2.3 | For manual: Run git blame, analyze intent | Commit messages captured |
| 2.4 | Apply manual resolutions per strategy | Conflict markers removed |
| 2.5 | Stage all resolved files | `git diff --check` clean |

### Phase 3: Validation (BLOCKING)

| Step | Action | Verification |
|------|--------|--------------|
| 3.1 | Verify session log exists | File at `.agents/sessions/` |
| 3.2 | Run session protocol validator | Exit code 0 |
| 3.3 | Run markdown lint | No errors |
| 3.4 | Commit merge resolution | Commit SHA recorded |
| 3.5 | Push to remote | Push successful |

## Workflow (Quick Reference)

1. **Fetch PR context** - Get title, description, commits
2. **Identify conflicts** - Find conflicted files in working directory
3. **Analyze each conflict** - Use git blame and commit messages
4. **Determine intent** - Classify changes by type
5. **Apply resolution** - Keep, merge, or discard based on analysis
6. **Stage resolved files** - Prepare for commit
7. **Validate session protocol** - BLOCKING: Run validation before push

## Step 1: Fetch PR Context

```bash
# Get PR metadata
gh pr view <number> --json title,body,commits,headRefName,baseRefName

# Checkout the PR branch
gh pr checkout <number>

# Attempt merge with base (creates conflict markers)
git merge origin/<base-branch> --no-commit
```

## Step 2: Identify Conflicts

```bash
# List conflicted files
git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U

# Show conflict details
git status --porcelain | grep "^UU"
```

## Step 3: Analyze Each Conflict

For each conflicted file:

```bash
# View the conflict
git diff --check

# Get blame for conflicting lines (base version)
git blame <base-branch> -- <file> | grep -n "<line-content>"

# Get blame for conflicting lines (head version)
git blame HEAD -- <file> | grep -n "<line-content>"

# Show commits touching this file on each branch
git log --oneline <base-branch>..<head-branch> -- <file>
git log --oneline <head-branch>..<base-branch> -- <file>

# View specific commit details
git show --stat <commit-sha>
```

## Step 4: Determine Intent

Classify each side's changes:

| Type | Indicators | Priority |
|------|------------|----------|
| Bugfix | "fix", "bug", "patch", "hotfix" in message; small, targeted change | Highest |
| Security | "security", "vuln", "CVE" in message | Highest |
| Refactor | "refactor", "cleanup", "rename"; no behavior change | Medium |
| Feature | "feat", "add", "implement"; new functionality | Medium |
| Style | "style", "format", "lint"; whitespace/formatting only | Lowest |

## Step 5: Apply Resolution

**Decision Framework:**

1. **Same intent, compatible changes** - Merge both
2. **Bugfix vs feature** - Bugfix wins, integrate feature around it
3. **Conflicting logic** - Prefer the more recent or more tested change
4. **Style conflicts** - Accept either, prefer consistency with surrounding code
5. **Deletions vs modifications** - Investigate why; deletion usually intentional

**Resolution Commands:**

```bash
# Accept theirs (base branch)
git checkout --theirs <file>

# Accept ours (PR branch)
git checkout --ours <file>

# Manual edit then mark resolved
git add <file>
```

**For manual resolution:**

1. Open file in editor
2. Remove conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)
3. Combine changes logically based on intent analysis
4. Verify syntax and logic
5. Stage the file

## Step 6: Stage and Verify

```bash
# Stage all resolved files
git add <resolved-files>

# Verify no remaining conflicts
git diff --check

# Show staged changes
git diff --cached --stat
```

## Step 7: Validate Session Protocol (BLOCKING)

**MUST complete before pushing.** This step prevents CI failures from incomplete session logs.

### Why This Matters

Session protocol validation is a CI blocking gate. Pushing without completing session requirements causes:

- CI failures with "MUST requirement(s) not met" errors
- Wasted review cycles
- Confusion about root cause (often misidentified as template sync issues)

### Validation Steps

```bash
# 1. Ensure session log exists
SESSION_LOG=$(ls -t .agents/sessions/*.md 2>/dev/null | head -1)
if [ -z "$SESSION_LOG" ]; then
    echo "ERROR: No session log found. Create one before pushing."
    exit 1
fi

# 2. Run session protocol validator
pwsh scripts/Validate-Session.ps1 -SessionLogPath "$SESSION_LOG"

# 3. If validation fails, fix issues before proceeding
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "ERROR: Session protocol validation failed."
    echo "Complete all MUST requirements in your session log before pushing."
    exit 1
fi
```

### Session End Checklist (REQUIRED)

Before pushing, verify your session log contains:

| Req | Step | Status |
|-----|------|--------|
| MUST | Complete session log (all sections filled) | [ ] |
| MUST | Update Serena memory (cross-session context) | [ ] |
| MUST | Run markdown lint | [ ] |
| MUST | Route to qa agent (feature implementation) | [ ] |
| MUST | Commit all changes (including .serena/memories) | [ ] |
| MUST NOT | Update `.agents/HANDOFF.md` directly | [ ] |

### Common Failures

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `E_TEMPLATE_DRIFT` | Session checklist outdated | Copy canonical checklist from SESSION-PROTOCOL.md |
| `E_QA_EVIDENCE` | QA row checked but no report path | Add QA report or use "SKIPPED: docs-only" for docs-only sessions |
| `E_DIRTY_WORKTREE` | Uncommitted changes | Stage and commit all files including `.agents/` |

## Resolution Strategies

See `references/strategies.md` for detailed patterns:

**Code Conflicts:**

- Combining additive changes
- Handling moved code
- Resolving import conflicts
- Dealing with deleted code
- Conflicting logic resolution

**Infrastructure Conflicts:**

- Package lock files (regenerate, don't merge)
- Configuration files (JSON/YAML semantic merge)
- Database migrations (renumber, preserve order)

**Documentation Conflicts:**

- Numbered documentation (ADR, RFC) - renumber incoming to next available
- Template-generated files - resolve in template, regenerate outputs
- Rebase add/add conflicts - per-commit resolution during rebase

## Auto-Resolution Script

For automated conflict resolution in CI/CD, use `scripts/Resolve-PRConflicts.ps1`:

```powershell
# Resolve conflicts for a PR
pwsh .claude/skills/merge-resolver/scripts/Resolve-PRConflicts.ps1 \
    -PRNumber 123 \
    -BranchName "fix/my-feature" \
    -TargetBranch "main"
```

### Auto-Resolvable Files

The following files are automatically resolved by accepting the target branch version:

| Pattern | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|
| `.agents/*` | Session artifacts, constantly changing |
| `.serena/*` | Serena memories, auto-generated |
| `.claude/skills/*/*.md` | Skill definitions, main is authoritative |
| `.claude/commands/*` | Command definitions, main is authoritative |
| `.claude/agents/*` | Agent definitions, main is authoritative |
| `templates/*` | Template files, main is authoritative |
| `src/copilot-cli/*` | Platform agent definitions |
| `src/vs-code-agents/*` | Platform agent definitions |
| `src/claude/*` | Platform agent definitions |
| `.github/agents/*` | GitHub agent configs |
| `.github/prompts/*` | GitHub prompts |
| `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml` | Lock files, regenerate from main |

### Script Output

Returns JSON:

```json
{
  "Success": true,
  "Message": "Successfully resolved conflicts for PR #123",
  "FilesResolved": [".agents/HANDOFF.md"],
  "FilesBlocked": []
}
```

### Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success - conflicts resolved and pushed |
| 1 | Failure - conflicts in non-auto-resolvable files |

### Security

ADR-015 compliance:

- Branch name validation (prevents command injection)
- Worktree path validation (prevents path traversal)
- Handles both GitHub Actions runner and local environments

## Verification

### Success Criteria

| Criterion | Evidence |
|-----------|----------|
| All conflicts resolved | `git diff --check` returns empty |
| No merge markers remain | `grep -r "<<<<<<" .` returns nothing |
| Session protocol valid | `Validate-SessionEnd.ps1` exits 0 |
| Markdown lint passes | `npx markdownlint-cli2` exits 0 |
| Push successful | Remote ref updated |

### Completion Checklist

- [ ] All conflicted files staged (`git add`)
- [ ] No UU status in `git status --porcelain`
- [ ] Session log at `.agents/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-session-NN.md`
- [ ] Session End checklist completed
- [ ] Serena memory updated
- [ ] Merge commit created
- [ ] Branch pushed to origin

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Instead |
|--------------|--------------|---------|
| Push without session validation | CI blocks with MUST violations | Run `Validate-SessionEnd.ps1` first |
| Manual edit of generated files | Changes lost on regeneration | Edit template, run generator |
| Accept --ours for HANDOFF.md | Branch version often stale | Accept --theirs (main is canonical) |
| Merge lock files manually | JSON corruption, broken deps | Accept base, regenerate with npm/yarn |
| Skip git blame analysis | Wrong intent inference | Always check commit messages |
| Resolve before fetching | Missing context, wrong base | Always `gh pr view` first |
| Forget to stage .agents/ | Dirty worktree CI failure | Include all `.agents/` changes |

## Extension Points

### Custom Auto-Resolvable Patterns

Add patterns to `$script:AutoResolvableFiles` in `Resolve-PRConflicts.ps1`:

```powershell
$script:AutoResolvableFiles += @(
    'your/custom/path/*',
    'another/pattern/**'
)
```

### Custom Resolution Strategies

Create new entries in `references/strategies.md` for domain-specific conflicts:

1. Document the conflict pattern
2. Add investigation commands
3. Define resolution priority
4. Provide copy-paste commands

### Integration with CI/CD

The script supports GitHub Actions via environment detection:

```yaml
# In workflow YAML
- name: Resolve conflicts
  env:
    PR_NUMBER: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
    HEAD_REF: ${{ github.head_ref }}
    BASE_REF: ${{ github.base_ref }}
  run: |
    pwsh .claude/skills/merge-resolver/scripts/Resolve-PRConflicts.ps1 \
      -PRNumber "$env:PR_NUMBER" \
      -BranchName "$env:HEAD_REF" \
      -TargetBranch "$env:BASE_REF"
```

### Dry-Run Mode

Use `-WhatIf` for testing without side effects:

```powershell
pwsh scripts/Resolve-PRConflicts.ps1 -PRNumber 123 -BranchName "fix/test" -WhatIf
```

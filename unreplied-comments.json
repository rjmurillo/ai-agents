{"author":"copilot-pull-request-reviewer","body":"This ADR is numbered ADR-007, but there is already an existing ADR-007-memory-first-architecture.md file in the same directory. This creates a naming collision that will cause confusion and ambiguity when referencing ADR-007. The new ADR should be renumbered to the next available number (appears to be ADR-011 based on the directory listing showing ADR-001 through ADR-010 already exist). All references to this ADR number in the planning documents and prompts should also be updated accordingly.\n```suggestion\n# ADR-011: Feature Request Review Step in Issue Triage Workflow\n```","commentId":2638113752,"path":".agents/architecture/ADR-007-feature-request-review-step.md","threadId":"PRRT_kwDOQoWRls5m7TVY"}

name: Label PR

# Automatically applies labels to PRs based on file paths and branch names

# Uses static configuration from .github/labeler.yml instead of AI analysis

#

# SECURITY NOTE: This workflow uses pull_request_target intentionally

# The actions/labeler action only reads file paths from the PR diff metadata

# and does not execute any code from the PR branch, making this safe for fork PRs

# See: <https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/>

# Concurrency control: Attempts to cancel in-progress runs when new runs start

# NOTE: GitHub Actions does NOT guarantee run coalescing - race conditions can occur

# where multiple runs start before cancellation takes effect. This is best-effort

# See ADR-026 (../.agents/architecture/ADR-026-pr-automation-concurrency-and-safety.md)

# for architectural decision on workflow-level concurrency control

# Mitigation: Path filtering, timeouts, and PR-specific temp files reduce impact

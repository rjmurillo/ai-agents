name: Label PR

# Automatically applies labels to PRs based on file paths and branch names
# Uses static configuration from .github/labeler.yml instead of AI analysis
#
# SECURITY NOTE: This workflow uses pull_request_target intentionally.
# The actions/labeler action only reads file paths from the PR diff metadata
# and does not execute any code from the PR branch, making this safe for fork PRs.
# See: https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/

# Validate Path Normalization
#
# Ensures documentation files use relative paths only.
# Prevents environment-specific absolute paths from contaminating documentation.
#
# IMPORTANT: This workflow runs on ALL PRs to satisfy required status checks,
# but skips actual validation when no relevant files are changed.
#
# Relevant paths:
# - All markdown files (**.md)
# - Validation script (build/scripts/Validate-PathNormalization.ps1)
# - This workflow file (.github/workflows/validate-paths.yml)
#
# Related: Issue rjmurillo/ai-agents#I3 (Environment Contamination)

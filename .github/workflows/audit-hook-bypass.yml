# Audit Hook Bypass Detection
#
# CI backstop that detects commits likely made with --no-verify.
# Analyzes PR commits for indicators that pre-commit hooks were bypassed.
# Non-blocking: reports findings for audit trail, does not block merge.
#
# Detection heuristics:
#   - Commits modifying .agents/ without session log
#   - HANDOFF.md modifications on feature branches
#   - Bash scripts added under .github/scripts/ (ADR-042)
#
# Related: Issue #664 (--no-verify bypass logging)
# Related: .githooks/pre-commit (local enforcement)

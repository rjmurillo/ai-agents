# PowerShell Lint
#
# Runs PSScriptAnalyzer on pull requests that modify PowerShell files.
# Serves as a CI safety net for syntax validation, complementing pre-commit hooks.
# Pre-commit hooks can be bypassed with --no-verify; this workflow ensures
# no syntax errors reach the main branch regardless of local developer setup.
#
# This workflow uses the existing Invoke-PSScriptAnalyzer.ps1 script which
# scans all PowerShell files and reports Error-level issues.
#
# Local developers can run the same analysis using:
#   pwsh ./build/scripts/Invoke-PSScriptAnalyzer.ps1

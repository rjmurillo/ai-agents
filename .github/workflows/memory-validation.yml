# Memory Validation for ADR-017 Compliance

#

# Validates memory files follow the tiered index architecture

# - Skill format validation (one skill per file, no bundled formats)

# - Index validation (proper Keywords|File table format)

#

# This is a REQUIRED check that blocks PRs from corrupting the memory system

# Pre-commit hooks can be bypassed; CI cannot

#

# Local developers can run the same validation using

# pwsh scripts/Validate-SkillFormat.ps1

# pwsh scripts/Validate-MemoryIndex.ps1

name: Memory Validation

# NOTE: No path filters here - workflow must always run because "Validate Memory Files"

# is a required status check. Path-based filtering happens inside the job using git diff

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
  workflow_dispatch: # Allow manual triggering

# Concurrency control: Attempts to cancel in-progress runs when new runs start

# NOTE: GitHub Actions does NOT guarantee run coalescing - race conditions can occur

# where multiple runs start before cancellation takes effect. This is best-effort

# See ADR-026 (../.agents/architecture/ADR-026-pr-automation-concurrency-and-safety.md)

# for architectural decision on workflow-level concurrency control

# Mitigation: Path filtering, timeouts, and PR-specific temp files reduce impact

# Note: Git diff-based path filtering happens inside the job

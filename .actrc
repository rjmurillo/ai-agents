# act Configuration
# Local GitHub Actions testing with nektos/act
# Documentation: https://nektosact.com

# Use GitHub-hosted runner images for maximum compatibility with production
# Use full images to match production environment ("no surprises")
# Note: Full images are ~18GB but provide complete tool parity with GitHub-hosted runners

# Windows runners not available in act - use self-hosted workaround
# This runs the workflow on the host machine instead of in a container
-P windows-latest=-self-hosted

# Enable artifact storage (for upload/download-artifact actions)
--artifact-server-path=.artifacts

# Enable caching support (for actions/cache)

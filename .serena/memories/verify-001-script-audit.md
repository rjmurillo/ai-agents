# Skill-Verify-001: Script Audit Protocol

## Statement

Audit generation scripts for unwanted functionality BEFORE execution.

## Context

Before running any code generation script, especially those that produce AI-consumed files.

## Evidence

Session 2025-12-17: `Get-AutoGeneratedHeader` dead code existed in `Generate-Agents.Common.psm1` and could have been accidentally re-enabled.

## Scoring

- **Atomicity**: 95%
- **Tag**: helpful
- **Impact**: 9
- **Priority**: P0

## Protocol

```text
1. Read the script completely
2. Search for patterns: "AUTO-GENERATED", "DO NOT EDIT", header/banner functions
3. Remove any such functionality
4. Verify output files don't contain unwanted metadata
```

## Anti-Pattern

Running generation scripts without auditing leads to unwanted metadata in files.

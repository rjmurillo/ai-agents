# GitHub Issue Assignment Protocol

## Rule

When starting work on a GitHub issue, **always assign it to yourself** if not already assigned.

## Command

```bash
gh issue edit <number> --add-assignee @me
```

## When to Apply

- At the **start** of work on any issue
- Before making any code changes
- Before creating branches related to the issue

## Rationale

- Prevents duplicate work by signaling ownership
- Provides visibility into who is working on what
- Required by project workflow conventions

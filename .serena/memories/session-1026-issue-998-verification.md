# Session 1026: Issue #998 Verification

**Date**: 2026-01-25
**Session**: 1026
**Issue**: #998 - Phase 2: Graph Traversal
**Status**: ✅ ALREADY COMPLETE

## Verification Summary

Issue #998 was already completed in previous sessions. Session 1026 verified all deliverables and exit criteria.

## Deliverables Verified

- ✅ `scripts/memory_enhancement/graph.py` - BFS/DFS traversal implementation
- ✅ Integration with Serena link formats
- ✅ Cycle detection implemented
- ✅ Command `python3 -m scripts.memory_enhancement graph --help` works

## Test Results

- All 60 tests pass in `tests/memory_enhancement/`
- Graph traversal tests (BFS/DFS) passing
- Cycle detection tests passing
- Link type filtering tests passing
- Root finding tests passing

## Exit Criteria Met

All exit criteria from issue #998 satisfied:

1. ✅ Can traverse memory relationships
2. ✅ Works with existing Serena memory format
3. ✅ `python -m memory_enhancement graph <root>` works

## Session Outcome

No implementation needed - verification only. Issue #998 confirmed complete from previous work (session 1025 had already verified this).

# Design: Handoff Scenario Coverage

## Skill-Design-008: Handoff Scenario Coverage

**Statement**: Handoff validation must cover Pass, Failure, and Special scenarios

**Context**: When designing handoff validation for agents

**Evidence**: Issue #44 Phase 4 - Each agent has 3 scenario checklists:

- critic: approval/revision/escalation
- implementer: completion/blocker/security-flagged
- qa: pass/failure/infrastructure
- task-decomposer: breakdown/reconciliation/scope

**Impact**: Comprehensive coverage of handoff paths, actionable guidance for all scenarios

**Atomicity**: 92%

**Tags**: helpful, completeness, coverage

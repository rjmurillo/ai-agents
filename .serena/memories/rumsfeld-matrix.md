# Rumsfeld Matrix

**Created**: 2026-01-10
**Category**: Decision Framework

## Overview

Decision-making framework categorizing knowledge and uncertainty into four quadrants. Named after Donald Rumsfeld's 2002 DoD press briefing. Originated from the Johari Window psychological model.

## The Four Quadrants

| Quadrant | Definition | Action |
|----------|------------|--------|
| **Known Knowns** | Facts we're aware of and understand | Foundation for decisions |
| **Known Unknowns** | Factors we know exist but don't fully understand | Research, expert consultation |
| **Unknown Knowns** | Elements buried in subconscious, overlooked | Surface through reflection |
| **Unknown Unknowns** | Factors we can't predict | Convert to known unknowns |

## Application

1. Categorize information using the matrix
2. Focus risk management on unknown unknowns
3. Use structured decision matrices (35% higher project success rate)
4. Address known unknowns through investigation

## Key Insight

The goal is converting unknown unknowns to known unknowns, making them manageable through standard project risk management.

# Pre-Implementation Validation Gate

**Statement**: Always run critic validation on plans before implementation begins

**Context**: Before implementing from any plan

**Evidence**: Critic review caught 3 minor issues before implementation

**Atomicity**: 92%

**Impact**: 9/10

## Validation Criteria

- **Completeness**: All requirements covered?
- **Feasibility**: Can be implemented as specified?
- **Scope**: Bounded appropriately?
- **Timeline**: Realistic estimates?
- **Risks**: Identified and mitigated?

## Anti-Pattern

Never skip critic review for changes affecting more than 5 files.

**Prevention**: Critic review is required gate for systemic changes.

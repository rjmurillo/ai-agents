# Skill-Design-001: Non-Overlapping Specialization

**Statement**: Each agent must have distinct purpose without duplicating another's responsibility

**Context**: Agent creation and review

**Evidence**: Agent consolidation process identified redundant agents requiring merger

**Atomicity**: 92%

**Impact**: 9/10

## Detection

Role overlap in agent definitions

## Fix

Use consolidation process from governance

## Anti-Pattern

- Two agents with similar descriptions
- Unclear which agent handles a task type

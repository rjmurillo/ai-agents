# Lindy Effect

**Category**: Decision Frameworks
**Source**: Nassim Nicholas Taleb, The Black Swan

## Core Concept

The future life expectancy of non-perishable things (technologies, ideas) is proportional to their current age. Systems that have survived longer tend to keep surviving.

## Key Insight

Mortality rate decreases with time. A 50-year-old programming language has better odds of surviving another 50 years than a 5-year-old language has of surviving another 5.

## Application

- Favor battle-tested technologies for critical systems
- Evaluate new technologies against the Lindy test before adoption
- Understand that "legacy" often means "proven survivor"
- Question the novelty bias in technology decisions

## Anti-Pattern

Chasing new frameworks because "old is bad." Old may mean robust.

## Example

SQL (1974) is more likely to still be used in 2075 than a NoSQL database from 2015 is to be used in 2065.

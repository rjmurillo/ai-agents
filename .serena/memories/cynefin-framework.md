# Cynefin Framework

**Category**: Problem-Solving
**Source**: `.agents/analysis/senior-engineering-knowledge.md`
**Origin**: Dave Snowden

## Purpose

Classify problems to choose appropriate response strategy.

## The Five Domains

| Domain | Characteristics | Response |
|--------|----------------|----------|
| **Clear** (Obvious) | Cause-effect clear to all | Best practice |
| **Complicated** | Cause-effect discoverable by experts | Expert analysis |
| **Complex** | Cause-effect only visible retrospectively | Probe, sense, respond |
| **Chaotic** | No cause-effect discernible | Act, sense, respond |
| **Confusion** | Unknown which domain applies | Gather information |

## Software Application

| Situation | Domain | Approach |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Debugging known issue | Complicated | Expert analysis, systematic diagnosis |
| User behavior prediction | Complex | Experiment and learn |
| Production outage | Sometimes chaotic | Act first, analyze later |
| New technology evaluation | Complex | Spike, prototype, learn |

## Key Insight

**Don't apply complicated thinking to complex problems.**

Complex problems require experimentation, not analysis paralysis.

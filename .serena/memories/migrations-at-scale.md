# Migrations at Scale

**Created**: 2026-01-10
**Category**: Change Management

## Overview

Managing risk and logistics of org-wide technology changes. Over 70% of large-scale digital transformations fall short of timeline or ROI expectations (McKinsey 2023).

## Why Migrations Fail

Leading causes:

- Lack of cross-functional alignment
- Insufficient change management
- Undocumented knowledge, assumptions, behavioral responses
- Resistance to change and knowledge gaps (often more significant than technical hurdles)

## Best Practices

### Discovery Phase

- Incorporate discovery sprints before execution
- Unearth undocumented logic
- Validate inter-team assumptions
- Highlight edge cases early
- Include 10-20% timeline buffer

### Execution Phase

- Start small with a pilot
- Gather performance metrics
- Scale to full workloads incrementally
- Use elastic governance framework that adapts

### Stakeholder Alignment

Every migration requires coordination across:

- Security
- Networking
- Infrastructure
- Operations
- Product teams
- Business leadership

Establish goals and objectives to foster alignment. All stakeholders must understand purpose and expected outcomes.

### Risk Management

Common risks: data loss, data incompatibility, performance slowdown, database overload, syncing issues.

Create risk assessment report:

- Determine all relevant risks
- Include opportunity costs and compliance issues
- Get stakeholder approval

## Framework

Define for each task:

- Owner
- Output
- Validation checkpoint

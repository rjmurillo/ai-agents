# Inversion Thinking

**Created**: 2026-01-10
**Category**: Mental Model

## Overview

Mental model from mathematician Carl Jacobi: "Invert, always invert."

Instead of asking "What should I do to succeed?" ask "What would guarantee failure?"

## Application

1. Identify your goal
2. Flip perspective: what would prevent that goal?
3. Identify counterproductive behaviors
4. Deliberately avoid them

## Key Insight

"Avoiding stupidity is easier than seeking brilliance." (Charlie Munger)

## Benefits

- Reduced harm from unintended consequences
- Clearer understanding through opposite perspective
- Practical efficiency: prevention requires less effort than optimization
- Forces deeper problem examination

## Examples

- **Organizational Innovation**: List what kills innovation, then avoid those practices
- **Personal Well-being**: Identify prescriptions for misery, then reverse them

## Practitioners

- Charlie Munger (investor)
- Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi (mathematician)

# Engineering as a Social Activity

**Category**: Engineering Leadership
**Source**: `.agents/analysis/senior-engineering-knowledge.md`

## Core Principle

Software is written by people, for people. Technical excellence without social skills limits impact.

## Key Skills

### Writing for Engineers

Clear writing outlives you. Artifacts:
- ADRs (decisions with context)
- RFCs (proposals for feedback)
- Design docs (thinking before coding)
- Commit messages (why, not what)

### Design Docs Before Code

Writing clarifies thinking. Cheap mistakes on paper, expensive in code.

**Structure**: Context, Goals, Non-Goals, Proposed Solution, Alternatives, Risks, Open Questions

### Mature Code Reviews

Less about nitpicking, more about intent and impact.

**Questions**: Is this understandable? Is this correct? Is this appropriate?

### Negotiating Requirements

Push back on ambiguous asks:
- "What's the most valuable thing here?"
- "What can we cut if needed?"
- "What happens if we're wrong?"

### Mentoring Over Teaching

Don't just explain. Invite others to think:
- Ask questions before giving answers
- Pair program on real work
- Share context (why, not just what)
- Let them struggle productively

### Cross-Functional Awareness

Learn concerns of PM, UX, QA, security. Design holistic systems.

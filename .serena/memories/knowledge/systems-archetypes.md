## Overview

Recurring patterns of behavior in organizations that typically result in negative consequences. Developed by Jay Forrester (1960s), Donella Meadows, Peter Senge (The Fifth Discipline, 1990).

## Common Archetypes

### Fixes That Fail

Quick fix addresses symptoms but creates unintended consequences that add to the symptoms.

**Intervention**: Address root cause, not symptoms.

### Shifting the Burden

Short-term solution makes underlying condition worse. Two balancing loops, one reinforcing feedback.

**Intervention**: Build fundamental solution capacity.

### Limits to Growth

Initial success slows to flatline and decline as system compensates with balancing force.

**Intervention**: Identify and address limiting factors early.

### Escalation

Competing parties respond to each other's actions, driving continuous escalation.

**Intervention**: Find mutually agreeable limits.

### Tragedy of the Commons

Individuals overuse shared resources, depleting them for all.

**Intervention**: Establish governance and incentives.

### Success to the Successful

Winners get more resources, widening gap with losers.

**Intervention**: Redistribute resources or opportunities.

### Eroding Goals

Adjusting goals downward to match declining performance.

**Intervention**: Maintain standards, address root causes.

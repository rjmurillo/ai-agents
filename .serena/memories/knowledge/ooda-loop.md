# OODA Loop

**Created**: 2026-01-10

## Overview

Decision-making cycle developed by U.S. Air Force Colonel John Boyd: Observe, Orient, Decide, Act.

## The Four Phases

### 1. Observe

Gather comprehensive information. Convert raw data into meaningful context. Filter irrelevant noise. Ask:

- What affects me now?
- What affects my competitor?
- What could affect either of us later?

### 2. Orient (Most Critical)

Recognize barriers to clear thinking:

- Cultural traditions (assumptions we think are universal)
- Genetic heritage (natural constraints)
- Old analytical habits
- Information overload

Build mental models from diverse disciplines.

### 3. Decide

Select course of action. Avoid first-conclusion bias. Treat decisions as testable hypotheses requiring Bayesian updating.

### 4. Act

Execute to gather feedback. Results inform next observation cycle.

## Competitive Advantage

Cycle faster than opponents. Speed creates:

- Deliberate action
- Comfort with uncertainty
- Unpredictability to competitors

"The ability to operate at a faster tempo enables one to fold the adversary back inside himself."

## Application

- Strategic decision-making in competitive markets
- Rapid market adaptation
- Organizational agility

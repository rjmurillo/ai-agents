# Skill-Retrospective Best Practices Index

## Purpose

Index of atomic retrospective process skills derived from Session 65 (PR #255 learning extraction). Use when conducting retrospectives, extracting learnings, or generating skills from observed patterns.

## Quick Reference

| ID | Name | Category | Impact |
|----|------|----------|--------|
| 001 | PR Retrospective Learning Extraction | retrospective | 9/10 |
| 002 | Retrospective-to-Skill Pipeline | retrospective | 10/10 |
| 003 | Token Impact Documentation | retrospective | 8/10 |
| 004 | Evidence-Based Skill Validation | retrospective | 9/10 |
| 005 | Atomic Skill Decomposition | retrospective | 10/10 |

## Memory References

Read individual skills:

- `skill-retrospective-001-pr-learning-extraction`
- `skill-retrospective-002-retrospective-to-skill-pipeline`

- `skill-retrospective-004-evidence-based-validation`
- `skill-retrospective-005-atomic-skill-decomposition`

## When to Use This Index

Use when:
- Conducting PR retrospectives
- Extracting learnings from successful sessions
- Converting analysis artifacts into skills
- Ensuring skills have evidence and validation tracking
- Decomposing multi-faceted improvements into atomic skills
- Documenting token savings or other quantitative impacts

## Workflow Summary

1. **Extract learnings** (skill-001): Read PR commits, identify patterns, quantify impact
2. **Transform to skills** (skill-002): Create Serena memory files with statement, context, pattern, evidence
3. **Document metrics** (skill-003): Track token savings, aggregate impact, include in artifacts
4. **Link evidence** (skill-004): Cite commit SHAs, PR numbers, enable validation tracking
5. **Ensure atomicity** (skill-005): One skill per concept, score 90%+ atomicity

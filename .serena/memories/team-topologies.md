## Overview

Framework for team structure and interaction patterns to enable fast flow of value. By Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais.

## Four Team Types

| Type | Focus |
|------|-------|
| **Stream-Aligned** | Deliver value directly to customers |
| **Enabling** | Provide support, remove obstacles |
| **Complicated-Subsystem** | Handle complex domains requiring expertise |
| **Platform** | Build and maintain shared infrastructure |

## Three Interaction Modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Collaboration** | Close working partnerships |
| **X-as-a-Service** | Self-service offerings |
| **Facilitating** | Guidance and knowledge transfer |

## Cognitive Load

Central insight: Platform's primary benefit is reducing cognitive load on stream-aligned teams.

Teams must maintain focus on core responsibilities without overwhelming complexity from dependencies.

## Application

1. Evaluate current structures against four types
2. Map interaction patterns between teams
3. Identify cognitive load bottlenecks
4. Redesign aligned with value streams

## Key Principles

- Organization is a socio-technical system
- Structure must align both people and technology
- Use bounded contexts to define responsibilities
- Treat internal platforms as products

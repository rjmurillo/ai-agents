## Overview

Tools for proactive alignment empowering teams to make quick, confident decisions. From Will Larson (Staff Engineer, An Elegant Puzzle).

## Three Layers

| Layer | Purpose | Horizon |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Vision** | How technology/org should work | 2-3 years |
| **Strategy** | Guide tradeoffs, explain rationale | Current |
| **Specifications** | Decisions in specific projects | Per project |

## Writing Approach

### Strategy

1. Write five design documents for significant projects
2. Synthesize similarities across documents
3. Document rationale behind decisions

### Vision

1. Write five strategies
2. Forecast implications 2 years forward
3. Reconcile contradictions

## Best Practices

- Start from the problem, not the solution
- Keep templates simple to encourage participation
- Be opinionated while showing reasoning
- Prioritize good work over perfection
- Include specific statements, not generic ones
- Write despite ambiguity

## Measurement

Don't measure vision by initial excitement. Measure by comparing design documents from two years ago to today. Marked improvement indicates good vision.

## Common Failure

Written strategies often fail because they're visions of ideal state, not accurate descriptions of current state. They don't help plot a course through today's challenges.

## Purpose

Knowledge framework for Distinguished Engineers, Fellows, and CTOs operating at organizational and industry scale. Focus on legacy systems, systemic governance, and generational technology leadership.

## Legacy-Level Thinking

| Concept | Key Insight | Quick Reference |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| Lindy Effect | Systems that survive longer tend to keep surviving | Favor battle-tested technologies |
| Second-System Effect | Rewrites tend to be over-engineered | Maintain humility when replacing success |
| Path Dependence | Past decisions constrain current options | Document why, not just what |
| Architectural Paleontology | Read the layers of legacy systems | Apply Chesterton's Fence |
| Golden Path vs Golden Cage | Enable, don't constrain | Escape hatches for exceptions |
| Uptime Inequity | Not all systems deserve same SLO | Classify by business criticality |

## Systemic Governance

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Sociotechnical Coherence | Technology and organization evolve together |
| Run vs Change the Business | Separate stable ops from innovation zones |
| Systemic Risk Portfolios | Classify dependencies and failure risk |
| Compliance as Code | Codify policy in executable form (OPA) |
| Data Lineage and Sovereignty | Track data across lifecycles and jurisdictions |

## Strategic Legacy Modernization

| Strategy | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| Strangler Fig | Incrementally replace legacy systems |
| Expand and Contract | Safe schema/API changes over time |
| Capability-Based Migration | Rebuild by user-facing capability |
| Sacrificial Architecture | Plan for replacement at 10x growth |
| Core/Context Mapping | Build core, buy context |

## Time Horizon Thinking

| Horizon | Focus | Investment |
|---------|-------|------------|
| H1 (0-1 yr) | Optimize current business | 70% |
| H2 (1-3 yr) | Emerging opportunities | 20% |
| H3 (3-10 yr) | Future bets | 10% |
| H4 (20+ yr) | Engineering heritage, sustainability | Strategic |

## Enterprise Leadership

| Practice | Goal |
|----------|------|
| Principle-Based Governance | Guide decisions via values, not rules |
| TOGAF / Enterprise Architecture | Cross-cutting tech-business integration |
| Technical Ethics | Fairness, privacy, transparency, safety |
| Digital Transformation | Cultural change alongside systems change |
| Knowledge Continuity | Prevent knowledge rot in long-lived systems |

## Essential Reading

| Book | Why |
|------|-----|
| The Mythical Man-Month | Team scale and complexity |
| Designing Data-Intensive Applications | Distributed data foundation |
| Thinking in Systems | Systems thinking models |
| The Fifth Discipline | Learning organizations |
| How Buildings Learn | Design-for-change across industries |

## Guiding Questions

- What long-term constraints are we embedding now?
- What will our successors wish we had written down?
- Are we creating a system that rewards the right behavior?
- What is aging well? What is rotting?
- What systems are invisible but critical?
- What can safely be forgotten?

## Deliverables That Scale

- Org-wide Technical Vision
- Long-term Architecture Principles
- Platform Capability Maps
- Succession Plans for Systems
- Governance Playbooks
- Heritage Documentation

# Three Horizons Framework

**Category**: Strategic Planning
**Source**: McKinsey

## Core Concept

Balance current operations, emerging opportunities, and future bets through structured investment allocation.

## The Horizons

| Horizon | Time Frame | Focus | Risk | Metrics |
|---------|------------|-------|------|---------|
| H1 | 0-1 years | Optimize current business | Low | Revenue, efficiency |
| H2 | 1-3 years | Emerging opportunities | Medium | Growth, market share |
| H3 | 3-10 years | Future bets | High | Learning, options |

## Investment Allocation

- H1: 70% of investment (sustain current business)
- H2: 20% of investment (grow into adjacencies)
- H3: 10% of investment (create future options)

## Technology Application

| Horizon | Focus Areas |
|---------|-------------|
| H1 | Infrastructure modernization, vendor risk, reliability |
| H2 | Platform shifts, architecture transitions, org models |
| H3 | Ecosystem positioning, legacy risk, standards |
| H4 (20+ yr) | Engineering heritage, open standards, sustainability |

## Key Insight

Allocating 100% to H1 guarantees future irrelevance. Allocating too much to H3 starves current operations.

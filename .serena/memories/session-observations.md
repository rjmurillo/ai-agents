# Skill Observations: session

**Last Updated**: 2026-01-18
**Sessions Analyzed**: 1

## Purpose

This memory captures learnings from session management, session protocol compliance, and session workflow patterns across sessions.

## Constraints (HIGH confidence)

These are corrections that MUST be followed:

## Preferences (MED confidence)

These are preferences that SHOULD be followed:

## Edge Cases (MED confidence)

These are scenarios to handle:

## Notes for Review (LOW confidence)

These are observations that may become patterns:

- Serena MCP unavailability should be documented explicitly - when MCP tools are unavailable, document the fallback approach (Session 2, 2026-01-15)
  - Evidence: Batch 37 - Serena MCP tools unavailable during session, used file-based memory operations as fallback

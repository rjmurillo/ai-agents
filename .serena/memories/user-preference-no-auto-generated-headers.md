# User Preference: No Auto-Generated Headers

## Requirement

User explicitly prohibits auto-generated headers in files.

## Evidence

**Session 2025-12-17**: User stated "The user had previously told me NOT to include auto-generated headers in files"

## Context

- Applies to all file generation (agent prompts, documentation, code files)
- No exceptions
- This is an explicit, repeated requirement

## What NOT to Include

```markdown
<!-- Auto-generated by Generate-Agents.ps1 -->
<!-- Last updated: 2025-12-17 -->
<!-- DO NOT EDIT -->
```

## Impact of Violation

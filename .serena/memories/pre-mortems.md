# Pre-Mortems

**Created**: 2026-01-10
**Category**: Risk Management

## Overview

Risk-identification technique where teams imagine their initiative has failed and work backward to identify causes. Based on "prospective hindsight."

## Key Insight

Research shows imagining an event has already occurred increases ability to correctly identify reasons for future outcomes by 30%.

## Pre-Mortem vs Post-Mortem

| Pre-Mortem | Post-Mortem |
|------------|-------------|
| Project inception | After failure |
| Improve the project | Autopsy the project |
| "What did go wrong?" | "What went wrong?" |

## Process

1. Brief team on project plan
2. Leader announces: "The project has failed spectacularly"
3. Participants independently write failure reasons (2-3 minutes)
4. Team members share one reason each, round-robin
5. Manager reviews list for improvement opportunities

## Psychological Benefits

- Reduces "damn-the-torpedoes attitude"
- Team members feel valued for intelligence and experience
- Creates psychological safety for dissenters
- Encourages early problem detection during execution

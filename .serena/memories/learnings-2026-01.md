# Session 826 Learnings (DEPRECATED)

**This file has been replaced by atomic memories for better recall.**

## Migration Notice

This consolidated learnings file has been decomposed into 6 atomic memories with descriptive names:

1. [[adr-artifact-count-verification]] - Verify artifact counts in ADRs before committing
2. [[powershell-variable-shadowing-detection]] - Detect automatic variable conflicts
3. [[pr-review-batch-response-pattern]] - Batch PR review responses in single commit
4. [[consensus-disagree-and-commit-pattern]] - Progress with documented dissent
5. [[adr-retroactive-amendment-criteria]] - When to write ADRs during implementation
6. [[retrospective-artifact-efficiency-pattern]] - Create artifacts during execution

## Why Deprecated

**Problem**: Date-based filename `learnings-2026-01.md` provides no semantic context. LLMs retrieving memories see only the filename, making recall difficult.

**Solution**: Domain-specific filenames like `powershell-variable-shadowing-detection.md` enable semantic retrieval based on content, not date.

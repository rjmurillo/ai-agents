# Products Over Projects

**Created**: 2026-01-10
**Category**: Organizational Design

## Overview

Shift from project-based to product-based thinking in software development. From Martin Fowler.

## Core Difference

| Projects | Products |
|----------|----------|
| Fund pre-defined solutions | Fund teams to address problems |
| Temporary teams for durations | Stable, long-lived teams |
| Scope gets funded | Teams get funded |
| Disband after delivery | Remain focused on evolution |

## Benefits

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Speed** | Eliminating handoffs reduces cycle time |
| **Knowledge** | Stable teams develop deeper expertise |
| **Quality** | Long-term ownership incentivizes integrity |
| **Responsiveness** | Quick pivots when conditions shift |

## Team Structure

Product-mode teams should be:

- **Cross-functional**: Dev, ops, ideation combined
- **Business-capability aligned**: Organized around customer value streams
- **Outcome-oriented**: Measured by business metrics, not scope

## Funding Model

- Projects: Time-limited funding tied to delivery schedules
- Products: Rolling annual budgets with periodic reviews

## Key Insight

"We build it, we run it" mindset enables quick pivots compared to sequential project queuing.

# Skill-Audit-001: Dead Code Detection

## Statement

When reading utility scripts, identify functions that are defined but never called, and remove them before execution

## Context

- **When to apply**: When examining PowerShell modules, utility libraries, or shared code before use
- **Trigger**: Reading script that will be executed, especially utilities with multiple functions
- **Priority**: P1 - Part of audit process

## Evidence

**Session 2025-12-17**: Get-AutoGeneratedHeader function existed in Generate-Agents.Common.psm1 but was never called, persisted as dead code affecting output

### What happened

- Read `Generate-Agents.Common.psm1` utility module
- Saw `Get-AutoGeneratedHeader` function definition
- Did NOT check if this function was actually called anywhere
- Did NOT question why function existed if unused
- Function was dead code that should have been removed
- Presence of dead code indicated script might have unwanted functionality

### Impact

- Dead code persisted in utilities
- Signal of potential unwanted behavior was missed
- Reduced code maintainability
- Created confusion about script's actual behavior

## Implementation Checklist

When reading utility scripts:

1. [ ] List all function definitions in the script
2. [ ] Search for each function name in the script and calling code
3. [ ] Mark functions that are defined but never called
4. [ ] For dead code: determine if it should be removed or is future-planned
5. [ ] If dead code relates to past user feedback (e.g., headers): REMOVE it
6. [ ] Document removal in commit message or comments
7. [ ] Only use script after dead code addressed

## Detection Pattern

```powershell
# Example dead code indicator:
function Get-AutoGeneratedHeader { ... }  # Defined
# But nowhere in script: Get-AutoGeneratedHeader  # Never called
# Conclusion: Dead code, remove it
```

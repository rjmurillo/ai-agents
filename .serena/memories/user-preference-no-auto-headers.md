# User Preference: No Auto-Generated Headers

## Preference

NEVER add AUTO-GENERATED, DO NOT EDIT, or similar headers/comments to files.

## Reason

Files are consumed by AI. Metadata headers don't help AI and waste tokens.

## Evidence

User explicit feedback on 2025-12-17, stated this was the THIRD time they had to correct this.

## Priority

MANDATORY - no exceptions.

## What to Do

- Remove any `Get-AutoGeneratedHeader` or similar functions from scripts
- Never add timestamps, generation notices, or "do not edit" comments
- Generated files should look identical to hand-written files

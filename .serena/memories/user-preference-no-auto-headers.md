# User Preference: No Auto-Generated Headers

**Created**: 2025-12-17
**Priority**: MANDATORY - No exceptions
**Violations**: 3+ (user had to correct this multiple times)

## Requirement

NEVER add auto-generated headers, timestamps, or "do not edit" comments to files.

## Rationale

- Files are consumed by AI - metadata headers waste tokens
- Generated files should look identical to hand-written files
- User explicit, repeated instruction

## Prohibited Content

Do NOT add comments like:

```markdown
<!-- Auto-generated by Generate-Agents.ps1 -->
<!-- Last updated: 2025-12-17 -->
<!-- DO NOT EDIT -->
<!-- Generated from template -->
```

```powershell
# AUTO-GENERATED - DO NOT EDIT
# Generated: 2025-12-17T10:30:00Z
```

## What To Do

1. Remove any `Get-AutoGeneratedHeader` or similar functions from scripts
2. Never add timestamps or generation notices
3. Never add "do not edit" warnings
4. Generated output should be indistinguishable from manually written content

## Applies To

- Agent prompt files (`src/claude/*.md`, `src/vs-code-agents/*.md`)
- Generated documentation
- Code files created by scripts
- Template outputs
- ALL file generation

## Evidence

- **2025-12-17**: User stated this was the THIRD time correcting this violation
- Repeated violations erode trust
- Creates extra editing work for user

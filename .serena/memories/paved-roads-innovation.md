# Paved Roads vs Innovation Paths

**Category**: Engineering Culture
**Source**: `.agents/analysis/advanced-engineering-knowledge.md`
**Origin**: Netflix engineering culture

## Core Concept

Provide well-supported default technology choices ("paved roads") while allowing deviation with justification ("innovation paths").

## Paved Roads

- Pre-approved, well-documented technology stacks
- Supported by platform teams
- Include templates, examples, and training
- Optimized for 80% of common use cases

## Innovation Paths

- Deviation from paved roads with explicit justification
- Team takes ownership of support and maintenance
- Requires documentation of why standard path is insufficient
- Successful innovations may become new paved roads

## Benefits

- Standardization without stifling innovation
- Reduced cognitive load for teams
- Clear ownership and support expectations
- Learning opportunities from deviations

## Implementation

1. Identify common technology needs
2. Evaluate and select default options
3. Document the paved roads
4. Define the process for deviation
5. Review innovations for potential standardization

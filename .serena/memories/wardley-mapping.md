# Wardley Mapping

**Category**: Strategic Thinking
**Source**: `.agents/analysis/senior-engineering-knowledge.md`
**Origin**: Simon Wardley

## Purpose

Map capability maturity to decide where to innovate vs commoditize.

## The Map Structure

**Y-axis (Value Chain)**: User needs at top, enabling components below

**X-axis (Evolution)**:
1. Genesis (novel, uncertain)
2. Custom (bespoke solutions)
3. Product (emerging standards)
4. Commodity (utilities, widespread)

## Decision Guidance

| Evolution Stage | Strategy |
|-----------------|----------|
| Genesis | Experiment, accept failure |
| Custom | Build competitive advantage |
| Product | Buy or build based on differentiation |
| Commodity | Use as utility, don't build |

## Application Example

| Component | Stage | Decision |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| AI/ML models | Genesis/Custom | Build (competitive advantage) |
| Authentication | Product | Buy (Auth0, Okta) |
| Cloud compute | Commodity | Use (AWS, Azure) |
| Logging | Commodity | Use (Datadog, Splunk) |

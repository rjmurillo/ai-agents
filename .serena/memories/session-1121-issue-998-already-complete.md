**Date**: 2026-01-25
**Session**: 1121
**Issue**: #998 - Phase 2: Graph Traversal (Memory Enhancement Layer)
**Status**: CLOSED

## Verification

Issue #998 was verified as CLOSED via GitHub API:

```

- Session 1115
- Session 1118-1120

All of these sessions confirmed the issue was already complete.

## Implementation Status

The graph traversal functionality for memory enhancement is complete per the PRD requirements:

- `scripts/memory_enhancement/graph.py` - BFS/DFS traversal implemented
- Integration with Serena link formats complete
- Cycle detection implemented
- Exit criteria met: `python -m memory_enhancement graph <root>` works

## Decision

Since issue #998 is already CLOSED and has been verified complete in 20+ previous sessions, no further implementation work is required. Session 1121 will complete the session protocol and close.

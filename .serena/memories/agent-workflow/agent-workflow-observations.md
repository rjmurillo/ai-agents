# Skill Observations: agent-workflow

**Last Updated**: 2026-01-18
**Sessions Analyzed**: 2

## Purpose

This memory captures learnings from agent coordination patterns, multi-agent workflows, and agent collaboration strategies across sessions.

## Constraints (HIGH confidence)

These are corrections that MUST be followed:

## Preferences (MED confidence)

These are preferences that SHOULD be followed:

- Multi-agent spec/plan review pattern - coordinate multiple specialized agents (10-15+) to review specification and implementation plans from different perspectives before execution (Session 67, 2025-12-22)
  - Evidence: Session 67 - "14-agent review of Local Guardrails SPEC and PLAN" synthesized findings from architect, security, qa, analyst, and other agents for comprehensive validation
- Model selection for CI automation - use Sonnet not Opus for automated CI/CD tasks to balance cost and capability (Session 4, 2026-01-16)
  - Evidence: Batch 37 - CI automation configured with Sonnet model for cost-effective automated processing

## Edge Cases (MED confidence)

These are scenarios to handle:

## Notes for Review (LOW confidence)

These are observations that may become patterns:

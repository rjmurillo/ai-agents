# Agent Generation: Edit Locations

**Last Updated**: 2026-02-07

## Constraint (HIGH confidence)

When editing orchestrator or any agent file that has a shared template, only edit these 3 locations:

1. `.claude/agents/` - Claude Code agent definitions
2. `templates/agents/` - Shared templates (single source of truth)
3. `src/claude/` - src/claude agent definitions

**DO NOT manually edit**:
- `src/copilot-cli/` - Auto-generated by `build/Generate-Agents.ps1`
- `src/vs-code-agents/` - Auto-generated by `build/Generate-Agents.ps1`

The pre-commit hook runs `Generate-Agents.ps1` which reads `.shared.md` templates and writes platform-specific output to `src/copilot-cli/` and `src/vs-code-agents/`.

## Also applies to

- `.github/agents/` - Check if this is also auto-generated (may need manual edit for GitHub Copilot platform)

## Evidence

User said: "btw, you only need to change @.claude/agents and @templates/ and @src/claude/; @build/Generate-Agents.ps1 will take care of writing to @src/copilot-cli/ and @src/vs-code-agents/"

# Principal Engineer Knowledge Index (15+ Years)

**Created**: 2026-01-10
**Category**: Engineering Knowledge Management
**Source**: `.agents/analysis/principal-engineer-knowledge-set.md`
**Consolidated from**: Sessions 816 and 819

## Purpose

Knowledge framework for Senior Staff+, Principal Engineers, and Architects operating at systems leadership level. Focus shifts from individual contribution to organizational effectiveness and long-term leverage.

## Core Role Shift

At 15+ years, optimization targets change:
- Individual output → System health over time
- Personal contribution → Org effectiveness
- Technical correctness → Clarity and alignment in ambiguity
- Feature delivery → Good decisions under incomplete information
- My project → Technical vision aligned with strategy

## Wisdom Over Practices

| Concept | Key Insight | Quick Reference |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| Chesterton's Fence | Understand before removing | Investigate existing rationale |
| Conway's Law | Architecture mirrors org structure | Inverse Conway Maneuver |
| Paved Roads & Guardrails | Enable, don't constrain | Balance standards with flexibility |
| Scaling Laws | Coordination costs grow nonlinearly | Use bounded contexts |
| Ownership vs Leverage | Enable others, don't do it yourself | Focus on multiplier effects |

## Strategic Thinking Models

| Model | Use Case |
|-------|----------|
| Wardley Mapping | Map capabilities against evolution |
| Cynefin Framework | Classify problems: Clear → Chaotic |
| OODA Loop | Rapid adaptation cycles |
| Inversion Thinking | Identify failure modes |
| Critical Path Method | Optimize key constraints |
| Rumsfeld Matrix | Manage uncertainty quadrants |
| Systems Archetypes | Recognize failure loops |

## Architectural Fluency

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| ADRs | Document decisions with context |
| Sociotechnical Design | Align org and architecture |
| Fitness Functions | Encode architectural intent |
| SLSA | Software supply chain security |
| Products Over Projects | Long-lived product teams |
| Strangler Fig | Incremental legacy modernization |

## Strategic Risk & Resilience

| Topic | Responsibility |
|-------|----------------|
| SLOs & Error Budgets | Define acceptable risk |
| Chaos Engineering | Prove resilience via failure |
| Threat Modeling | Identify flaws during design |
| Pre-Mortems | Predict failure before it occurs |

## Staff Engineer Archetypes

| Archetype | Focus |
|-----------|-------|
| Tech Lead | Guide team execution |
| Architect | Technical direction across orgs |
| Solver | Deep problems needing expertise |
| Right Hand | Extend executive capacity |

## Key Deliverables

- Tech Vision Document
- Architecture Working Group
- Service Maturity Models
- Pattern Libraries
- Postmortem Forums

## Mental Shifts

| From | To |
|------|-----|
| "How do I build it?" | "How do others build it well?" |
| Delivering features | Maximizing flow and leverage |
| My project | Org-wide capability health |
| Correctness | Tradeoffs, resilience, alignment |

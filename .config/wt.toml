[post-create]
# Configure git hooks path to .githooks directory
# This ensures pre-commit and other hooks work in worktrees

# Copy gitignored files from main worktree to eliminate cold starts
# Files listed in .worktreeinclude (node_modules, .cache, etc.)

[pre-merge]
# Run markdown linting before merge to catch documentation issues
# Fails on violations without modifying files (no --fix flag prevents uncommitted changes during merge)
